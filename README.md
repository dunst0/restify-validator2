restify-validator2
==================

restify-validator2 is middleware for [restify] that integrates with the [node-validator] module.

restify-validator2 borrows some ideas from [restify-validator], but differs in how it specifies where to find the data to be verified. The original restify-validator's `req.check` method always looks for values in `req.params`, restify-validator2 allows you to specify an object to pull that value from (i.e. `req.body`, `req.params`, etc.).
